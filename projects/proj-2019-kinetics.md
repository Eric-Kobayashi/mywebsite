I designed a 6-parameter model for the 3-enzyme biochemical process involving ubiquitin, and fitted the experimental data using simulated annealing. Subsequently, I ran Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation to determine the Bayesian posterior of the kinetics parameters.

This work gave me hands-on experience with molecular simulation with MATLAB as well as working with HPC.
