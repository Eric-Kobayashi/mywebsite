This is a collaborative project with my colleagues in the Human Genettics Informatics. We use R Shiny to build a web application for visualising the metrics of computational jobs on the HPC (High performance computing) from the LSF (Load Sharing Facility) job scheduler. The goal is to identify resource wastefulness and suggest improvements. The data source is Elasticsearch.

I contributed to building the Nextflow pipeline visualisation so that each Nextflow step can be analysed individually. In addition to the frontend and backend technologies, I also learned about UI design and experienced pair programming. Have to say it was really enjoyable and so far one of my favourite projects!
