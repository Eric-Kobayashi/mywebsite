This was an "off-path" programme for me. Grateful to spend the 3 weeks in Japan (during the height of my PhD doing multiple projects at once!), experience the culture and the countryside and make lots of friends. I participated in workshops, factory tours, and local projects in Tokyo and Kagawa, focusing on innovation and creative problem-solving. I promised to myself that I would one day come back and live and work here, since then I have been practicing my Japanese language skills!

I have lost contact with many people from this programme (especially the then high school students), but if you were there and want to get in touch, I would love to hear from you and please drop me an email (see the contact page)!
