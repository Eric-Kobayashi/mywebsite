Another favourite project of mine. Let LLM to write Jira tickets for you? WHYNOT! 

Jokes aside, it is a toy project that I used to explore with more vibe coding and LLM. Initially I tried to use Ollama hosted local model, and actually it worked pretty well. However, it feels impolite to keep running an instance of LLM as an HPC job using GPU resources, so I switched to (pay as you go) GPT-5.

Would you like to try some Jirato üç®?
