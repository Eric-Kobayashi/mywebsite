This started as a hackathon project within the Wellcome Genome Campus. We created an AI chatbot builder using [MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/), with locally hosted LLM (llama3) and Slack integration. 
    
During the event, I provided guidance for other participants to modify the prompts and create their own chatbots with little programming required. Months after the hackathon, I hosted a training workshop for more people on campus to try out the chatbot builder, deployed on their laptops using Docker. 

However, the capability of these chatbots was not satisfactory and I struggled to find a suitable real-life scenario for their usage. This experience inspired me to look into the agentic approach for LLM application that led to the creation of the above Softpack recipe agent.
