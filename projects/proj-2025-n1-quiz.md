While revising for the JLPT N1 exam, I had a vocabulary and grammar exercise book that provides problem sets and answers but unfortunately no explanation for the answers. So I decided to use LLM again, and ask it to only respond in Japanese.

The fact that the LLM could get the answer correct 95% of the time is pretty impressive (for the rest of 5%, I just switched to another LLM model XD). It also provides a form of confirmation that the generated explanation makes sense. In this case I used mostly Google Gemini 2.5 as I found it works well with Japanese. I spent lots of time typing the problems and choices in Japanese, not because LLM cannot do the OCR (it is more than capable), but because I wanted to memorise the words and their yomi better.

After the explanations are generated and checked, I just spent another 20 minutes to vibe code this app.
